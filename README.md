This is a very simple Todo app meant to accompany a post series I wrote for the [Ionic Blog](http://blog.ionic.io/). The purpose of this post was to the demonstrate Ionic 2, Angular 2, HTTP API calls to a Node.js/Express backend, using a free MongoLab database provisioned by Heroku.

**Note** This post was written when Ionic 2 was in Beta 11. There may be subtle differences between this app and an app built with the latest version of Ionic. 

You can check out the tutorial here:
